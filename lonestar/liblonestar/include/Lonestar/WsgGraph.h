// Reads the GAP Benchmark Suite serialized weighted graph format (.wsg), so
// that this driver consumes the very same graph file as the other
// implementations in the relax-experiments harness. Node numbering is then
// identical by construction, which is what makes a shared .sources file valid.
//
// Lives in liblonestar so any lonestar app can use it, not just SSSP.
//
// Layout, as written by gapbs / wasp's include/writer.h:
//
//   bool    directed
//   int64   num_edges                 (directed edge count)
//   int64   num_nodes
//   int64   offsets[num_nodes + 1]    out-edge CSR offsets
//   struct { int32 dst; W weight; }   [num_edges]
//   if directed:
//     int64 in_offsets[num_nodes + 1]
//     struct { int32 src; W weight; } [num_edges]   (unused by SSSP)
//
// The file is mapped rather than read into a buffer: these graphs reach
// billions of edges, and the edge section is consumed once, in order.
